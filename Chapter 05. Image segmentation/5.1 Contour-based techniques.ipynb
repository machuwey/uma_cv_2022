    "# 5.1 Contour-based techniques for image segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Image segmentation is the process of **assigning a label to every pixel in an image** such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics. As a consequence, it produces regions whose pixels have similar properties (*e.g.* intensity, color, texture, or location in the image) which have a geometric and semantic meaning (see Fig.1). The result of image segmentation could be:\n",
    "- a set of segments that collectively cover the entire image (e.g. thresholding), \n",
    "- or a set of contours extracted from the image (e.g. edge detection).\n",

    "\n",
    "Conceptually, two traditional approaches to image segmentation exist (see Fig. 2):\n",
    "- **Top-down segmentation** *(semantic segmentation)*, which considers that pixels from the same object in the scene should be in the same segmented region.\n",
    "- **Bottom-up segmentation** *(pixel-driven segmentation)*, which establishes that similar pixels in the image must be in the same segmented region. $\\\\[5pt]$\n",
